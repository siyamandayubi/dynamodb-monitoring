# dynamodb-monitoring (Work in progress)
Dynamodb Monitoring is an AWS cloud tool that manages the process of setting up and configuring the infrastructure to consume Dynamodb streams and store the aggregated data in RDS databases. The tool creates necessary AWS resources such as lambda functions, proxies, rds instances, secrets etc, but it doesn't consume the streams directly. The tool can be applied to the any DynamoDB table.
