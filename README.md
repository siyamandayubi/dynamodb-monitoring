# dynamodb-monitoring
Dynamodb Monitoring is a cloud tool that helps you to set up and configure the infrastructure to store the aggregate data of Dynamodb tables in RDS databases. The tool creates necessary lambda functions that receive data from Dynamodb streams and stores the aggregate data in distributed RDS instances. You can apply the tool to the any DynamoDB table.
